          <h2>Book of Caverns</h2>
          <p>The Book of Caverns is a royal mortuary text that first appeared during the 19th Dynasty (after about 1295 BCE), painted or inscribed on the walls of the upper section of royal tomb interiors.</p>
          <p>The Book of Caverns focuses on the sun god Ra, and by association the deceased person, passing a series of caverns or pits in the Netherworld and uniting with the god Osiris. It depicts the destruction of the sun god’s enemies and stresses the rewards and punishments in the afterlife. The ultimate punishment includes beheading and annihilation, with the beheaded souls condemned to nonexistence. This punishment is the closest Ancient Egyptian concept to hell that we know.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position2">
          <h2>Why is this papyrus significant?</h2>
          <p>This 3.96 meter papyrus, is one the earliest known Books of the Dead written in hieratic (a cursive rather than hieroglyphic writing system). In 2010 this text was described as the only known papyrus to contain scenes from the Book of Caverns, which is normally only found on tomb walls.</p>
          <p>One scene in this papyrus (on a sheet that is not shown here) links Amun-Ra-Horakhty with Osiris, another innovation. By the time this papyrus was written at the end of the New Kingdom about 1069 BCE the ancient sun god Ra was linked with the important Theban deity Amun as Amun-Ra, and also as Amun-Ra-Horakhty (the god in the morning horizon).</p>
          <p>Additionally, this papyrus introduces a new spell to the suite of spells in the ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead – “Spell for bringing the garland of triumph during the wag festival in Upeqer, the first month of the akhet season (day&nbsp;4).”</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position3">
          <h2>Nodjmet, the Queen of Egypt</h2>
          <p>Nodjmet was the Queen of Egypt and the wife of Herihor, an important military officer and High Priest of Amun at Thebes. Nodjmet lived at the beginning of the 21st Dynasty, the Third Intermediate Period (about 1069 – 945 BCE).</p>
          <p>At the end of New Kingdom (between about 1550 – 1069 BCE), central power in Egypt ceased, and the official kings ruled Lower Egypt (the Nile delta and nearby areas) from Tanis. The Theban high priests of Amun effectively ruled all of Middle and Upper Egypt along the Nile valley.</p>
          <p>Nodjmet is the central human figure of this papyrus, which contains a series of Book of the Dead spells written in hieratic (a cursive rather than hieroglyphic writing system), combined with images from the Book of Caverns.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position4">
          <h2>Ra</h2>
          <p>The sun god Ra is depicted as a ram-headed figure who enters the Netherworld in the first Cavern of the West, addressing the gods who are present.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position5">
          <h2>Snakes</h2>
          <p>Three snakes of the Duat’s (the Egyptian underworld) first cavern facing the cave’s entrance.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position6">
          <h2>Osiris</h2>
          <p>Ra (the sun god) is linked with Osiris (god of the afterlife) who is visible in the cavern surrounded by a protective serpent.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position7">
          <h2>Enemies</h2>
          <p>The sun god’s enemies are shown decapitated, bound and headed for the Place of Annihilation where their souls will be condemned to non-existence.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position8">
          <h2>1</h2>
          <p>Osiris, the god of the afterlife, is depicted is in his cavern between Isis (his wife and sister, protector of the dead) and Nepthys (Isis’ sister and protector of the dead and Osiris). The goddesses raise the body of Osiris to commence his resurrection.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position9">
          <h2>2</h2>
          <p>The disk enters the cavern, Osiris is cared for by Horus (his son, patron of Pharaoh and the nobles) and Anubis (protector of the dead, and deity who leads the dead to the “Hall of Judgement”).</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position10">
          <h2>3</h2>
          <p>This scene with the ichneumon (mongoose) of Horus is unclear; one suggestion is that the bull headed figure is Osiris as the Bull of the West, and the mongoose represents his son Horus-Mekhentienirty</p>
        </li>
        <li data-position="position11">
          <h2>Rebirth</h2>
          <p>The vignette shows the rebirth of the sun after his journey in the underworld. During the rebirth, the sun emerges as a scarab beetle, towed on a solar ship by 12 gods, and other figures are rejoicing at the occasion. On the right of the vignette, Ra, now with a ram’s head, is proceeding feet first towards the horizon and the rising sun. The child adjoined to the sun, represents continual solar rebirth.</p>
